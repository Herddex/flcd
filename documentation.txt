Execute 'cargo run -- [path to source code file]' in the repository's src folder.

The project uses a scanner to separate all the tokens from the source code file, including by non-whitespace separators.
The scanner and then the classifier determine if the program is lexically correct.
The classifier also adds identifiers and constants into the Symbol Table.

The Symbol Table is a hash table with a simple hash function (sum of char codes) and implemented with separate chaining.

The program's output is all the scanned tokens, and then the Symbol Table in debug format.
